```cpp
ttt_analgesic_random_team                   0.50    // The chance that the drunk will join the team that uses it
ttt_analgesic_jester_use                    0       // Whether the gun does anything if a Jester Team uses it
ttt_analgesic_not_drunk                     1       // How to handle if the gun is used on someone who isn't drunk
